# RepoAudit: Auditing Code As Human

RepoAudit is an autonomous LLM-agent designed for large-scale, repository-level code auditing. It revolutionizes static analysis by being:

- **Build-Free:** Analyze your source code directly without compilation. Detect potential bugs during developmentâ€”even in incomplete code generated by AI tools like Copilot.
- **Easy-to-Customize:** No need to dig into compiler internals such as LLVM IR. Simply write custom prompts using few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to tailor RepoAudit to your project's needs.
- **Multi-Lingual:** Out-of-the-box support for multiple programming languages, including C/C++, Java, and Go, with additional language support under active development.

## Features

- **Automated Code Auditing:** Leverage the power of advanced large language models to identify bugs and vulnerabilities in your code.
- **Customizable Detectors:** Easily extend RepoAudit with new bug detectors and integrate your own knowledge base for multi-modal analysis.
- **Dynamic Bug Reporting:** View bug reports and detailed logs, and even submit issues for confirmed bugs.
